App to control the PEG88S jumping car.

3. Use `WASD` for navigation, `Shift` for acceleration and `Space` for jumping;
4. PROFIT!!!

### Known issues

1. Control delays - you can try to tune udp send timeout
2. Video problems - you can try to improve video code
3. Cannot connect after closing app - IDK. Maybe problem with sockets.
